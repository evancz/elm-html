# DEPRECATED

Use [`elm-lang/html`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/latest/) instead. It's way better!


## Story

When Elm 0.17 came out, [the changes](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-platform/blob/master/upgrade-docs/0.17.md) included a revamp of the HTML API to replace some old concepts (signals and address) with something simpler. To make that possible, it was necessary to reimplement this library from scratch. That also seemed like a great opportunity to officially graduate this library to [the elm-lang organization](https://github.com/elm-lang/). Through all this, the public API changed very little.
